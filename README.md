# DJMixerStudio
C++ DJ Deck Application - my Final Project for the OOP module in UoL

<h2>Project Info</h2>
This project was submitted as part of my BSc with the University of London.
<br>
It was submitted in March 2022 and slightly revised (as per July 2022) to match the new version of Juce.
<br>
This app was created with strict Object Oriented Programming principles and earned me the grade of: <b>93.3</b>

<h2>Project Highlights</h2>
DJ Mixer Studio has several important features:

- <b>DJ Deck Component</b> which allows you to load 2 different music tracks simulteniously(either from the playlist or directly from your computer). The DJ Deck component also allows you to play/stop/mute each track and control their speed, volume, playhead position and even waveform colour.
- <b>Playlist Component</b> which allows you to load up to 7 different tracks from your computer, unload them, clear them, search then, as well as play and stop each track (before even loading it to a given deck).
- <b>Recording Component</b> which allows you to record microphone input and save it in the <b>Documents</b> directory. Also allows you to load the recording straight into the Playlist Component (from which it can be loaded to any of the decks)
- All playlist tracks remain loaded even after the application is closed.
